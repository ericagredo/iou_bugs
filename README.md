# IOU Bug Tracker 🐛

Hey! Thanks for the support in making this app even better. This will serve as a bug tracker for [IOU](https://splittab.app), so if you have a bug to report you can check the “Issues” tab up above to see if it's already been reported. 

### How do I report a bug?

To create a report, you'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/), which is free to create.

Then, go to the “Issues” tab at the top, then select “New Issue” and simply fill in the form. Before submitting, however, *please* check the issues tab to see if the issue has been reported.
